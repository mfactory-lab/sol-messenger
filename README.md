# CGram: On-Chain Messaging Platform on Solana

**CGram**—short for ChainGram—is a decentralized, on-chain messaging platform that provides a secure means of communication between blockchain users. Built on the **Solana blockchain**, CGram is built on a proprietary protocol to ensure anonymous and encrypted communication.

## Features

### Secure and private communication
CGram stores all messages in encrypted form directly on the Solana blockchain, ensuring complete privacy and anonymity for its users.

### Smart Validator Toolkit (SVT) integration
CGram integrates with the [**Smart Validator Toolkit (SVT)**](https://svt.one/), providing validator operators with a dedicated, secure on-chain communication channel. This integration enables:
- Command execution on validator nodes via **Agent**, a program installed on the validator server.
- Secure initiation of processes like running **Ansible playbooks** or managing validator-related tasks.

### Broadcasting capabilities
CGram enables broadcasting messages to delegators or stakeholders, making it great for:
- Validator node operators.
- Stake pool projects requiring mass communication.

### Mobile and composable
CGram is optimized for mobile use and can be seamlessly integrated with other on-chain and off-chain services.

## Planned features

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Cross-chain messaging**  
  Support for cross-chain communication, including EVM-compatible blockchains.

- **Payment integration**  
  Seamless payment functionality for over-the-counter (OTC) deals.

- **Escrow service**  
  Optional escrow services to enhance trust in transactions.

- **Mobile app**  
  A dedicated mobile application for enhanced accessibility.
